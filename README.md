<!-- ## developement
The smart contracts are build using truffle and tested locally using ganache-cli. -->


## test
it is assumed that you have nodejs and yarn installed. You also need to have metamask extension.

The next steps will be:
1. Clone project
2. yarn in main directory will install all dependencies
```
yarn
```
3. yarn start will run DApp http://localhost:3000/
```
yarn start
```


## Todo

- Responsive on mobile
- Text for homepage (story with links?)
- error handling
- Fix the refresh needed after connection! 
- HTML headers, we need to add meta data there for link previews and SEO.
